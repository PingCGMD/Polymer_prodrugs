Quick and dirty installation

    Get the latest version of your C and C++ compilers.
    Check that you have CMake version 3.4.3 or later.
    Get and unpack the latest version of the GROMACS tarball.
    Make a separate build directory and change to it.
    Run cmake with the path to the source as an argument
    Run make, make check, and make install
    Source GMXRC to get access to GROMACS

Or, as a sequence of commands to execute:

tar xfz gromacs-2019.tar.gz
cd gromacs-2019
./configure -prefix=/home/ping/software/gromacs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/ping/software/gromacs
make
make check 
sudo make install (or make install)
source /home/ping/software/gromacs/bin/GMXRC

gedit ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc



for g_aggregate
before use g_aggregate: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/ping/software/gromacs/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
after use g_aggregate, before start gmx, close this sheet
